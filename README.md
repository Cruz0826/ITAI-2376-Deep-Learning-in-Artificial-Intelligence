**Author:** Alicia Gonzalez Cruz  
**Course:** ITAI 2376  
**Instructor:** Anna Devarakonda
**Term:** Summer 2025  
**Format:** Individual Submission Portfolio  

Welcome to my Deep Learning portfolio for ITAI 2376. This repository includes my assignments from each module of the course, showcasing my learning and creativity as I explored key deep learning concepts. Each assignment is either a written report, presentation, or creative submission designed to demonstrate both theoretical understanding and practical applications.

## ðŸ“‚ Module 2: Neural Network Zoo

**Assignment:** Neural Network Zoo Activity  
In this fun and creative assignment, I explored different types of neural networks by representing them as animals in a zoo. I focused on one specific network and described its structure, use cases, and characteristics in an accessible way.

## ðŸ“‚ Module 3: Teaching Deep Learning to Kids

**Assignment:** Explain a Deep Learning Concept to an 11-Year-Old  
The goal of this assignment was to explain a core concept in deep learning in a simple, creative, and engaging way. I chose the topic of **Tensors** and created a presentation that breaks down the idea so it's understandable to a younger audience.

## ðŸ“‚ Module 4: Language, AI, and Film

**Assignment:** Analyzing *Arrival* Through the Lens of NLP  
This individual assignment connects themes from the movie *Arrival* (2016) to real-world challenges in Natural Language Processing (NLP). I analyzed key scenes in the movie and reflected on how they relate to rule-based NLP, ambiguity, and communication models in AI.

## ðŸ“‚ Module 5: Final AI Agent Project

**Assignment:** Create a Simple AI Agent  
This final module involved developing a working AI agent using concepts learned in the course. The project demonstrates how neural networks can be applied to build intelligent systems. *(Details and files for this module can be added once complete.)*
