# ITAI-2376-Deep-Learning-in-Artificial-Intelligence

Welcome to my portfolio for **ITAI2376 â€“ Deep Learning in Artificial Intelligence**. This repo includes all my work from the course: notes, assignments, and my final AI Agent project.


## What This Course Covered

Throughout this course, I learned the fundamentals of deep learning, including:

- How neural networks work (ANNs, CNNs, RNNs, etc.)
- Working with PyTorch and TensorFlow
- Sequence modeling (LSTM, GRU)
- Unsupervised learning like Autoencoders and GANs
- Ethics and real-world applications of Deep Learning
- How to build and train a full AI agent


## Final Project â€“ AI Agent

For my final project, I built an AI Agent that can:  
 [Brief description â€” e.g., classify images, generate text, answer questions, etc.]

The code, model, and documentation can be found in the `FinalProject_AI_Agent/` folder.
