📁 Assignment 3: Neural Network Zoo

This folder contains my assignment for ITAI2376 – Deep Learning in Artificial Intelligence about the Neural Network Zoo.

📝 Assignment Overview:

Learned the basics of neural networks and how neurons connect in layers.
Explored different types of neural networks, each represented as an “animal” in the Neural Network Zoo (like CNN = Cheetah, RNN = Raccoon, LSTM = Lemur).
Researched one type of neural network in detail (Transformer – The Octopus of the Neural Network Zoo.
Created a presentation with visuals explaining the network’s structure, function, and common applications.
Reflected on how different networks suit different AI tasks.

📂 What’s Inside:

Presentation slides (e.g., PDF or PowerPoint)
Any visuals or diagrams created
This README file
This assignment helped me understand the diversity of neural network architectures and their strengths.
